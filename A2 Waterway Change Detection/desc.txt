// A2: Waterway automatic change detection 14/2/2023
// Original script by Jonathan S. Lim, University of Oxford/Nalaquq LLC., jlim@nalaquq.com 14/2/2023

// This is a script for carrying out relative pixel-based change detection on Planetscope imagery within Google Earth Engine. 
// It is optimised for highlighting erosion between two uploaded images from different dates, where vegetation is present.
// It has been tested on imagery from Southwest Alaska during the summer months. It outputs a change detection raster,
// and offers two ways to isolate values between a certain range on the change raster, either by sampling an area
// with a polygon drawn in the map window, or by inputting a fixed range of values in line 23-24. There are four steps to be followed below. (Lines 10,15,18,22)
